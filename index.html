As your attorney, he has experience working in multiple jurisdictions as public defenders and private counsel at the trial and appellate levels. We find that our diverse backgrounds allows us to connect with our clients at a very fundamental level. Criminal defense is by nature, a very human endeavor.

            </div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">One of the problems with the criminal “justice” system is access to justice. For those who are legally indigent, a public defender is automatically appointed. For those who are slightly above the federal poverty line, they go bankrupt spending thousands of dollars on expensive representation. Those who are rich can hire the “best”.<br><br>To be clear, many public defenders are stellar lawyers. We have had the pleasure of working with many incredibly talented public defenders in Washington state. However, it is true that public defenders have insane caseloads and simply cannot devote the requisite time to each and every case. We know, we’ve been there.<br><br>That is why we have developed our own unique philosophy and approach to criminal defense: we like to consider ourselves lawyers for the “middle class”. We will give you the big firm treatment, but for a middle-class price.</p></div>

            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">We believe there should be a middle ground between the two, very opposite choices of being forced to go with a public defender, or going bankrupt for an expensive, fancy lawyer: securing excellent representation while not going broke.<br><br>At Ryan English, we keep our costs and overhead low. We do not believe in frivolous expenditures, like a high-rise office or thousand-dollar Italian suits. After all, the client ends up bearing those costs.

            </div>
            <div class="timeline-body"><p class="text-muted">The saying “you can catch more bees with honey than vinegar” is something that many lawyers do not understand. The truth is, being the stereotypical uncompromising, combative defense lawyer often times backfires. And who suffers from that? The client. We have cordial, professional working relationships with our adversaries. Of course there are situations that necessitate a more aggressive approach. But, our experience has shown that better results are achieved by simply being courteous, agreeable, and respectful with our adversaries and judges.<br><br>Many lawyers will often tout their experience in claiming they are great at what they do. But, this is a logical fallacy: just because you have been doing something for a long time, that does not necessarily mean you’re good at it. It’s particularly laughable when a lawyer calls him or herself “the best”. What exactly is unit of measure? Because you say so? Although we bring over 20 years in combined experience to the table, we are worth our salt not because of our time served, but because of the results we deliver</p></div>

        </div>
        <p>Ryan was born and raised in the greater Los Angeles area but left when he was 18. Since then, he has lived up and down the west coast and southwest, has attended 6 different colleges, worked numerous jobs, and met some really interesting people in the process. Washington is by far his favorite state, and he now considers himself a Washingtonian. He started working when he was 13 as a math and reading tutor. He then worked throughout high school, whether it was washing cars, mowing lawns, tending a cash register, collecting shopping carts, or soliciting people for blood donations. He also worked through college as a salesman, a music teacher, and then as a car mechanic to pay the bills. Finally, he ended up back in Los Angeles after bouncing around from college to college and graduated with a degree in philosophy with a pre-law minor. Ryan's passion is working on cars (especially classics), and he has continued to do that until enrolling in law school. Ryan has had a variety of unusual and unique experiences throughout life that have helped him connect with his clients.
        <br><br>
        Ryan's father and step-father were both cops, so naturally he became a defense lawyer. Throughout law school, Ryan worked, first for a superior court judge, criminal trial attorney, then a firm doing criminal appeals, and then the Department of Public Defense in King County. Due to the circumstances his employer created, he worked on multiple criminal appeals involving serious felony convictions with scarce or no supervision. From that, he learned the intricacies of criminal, appellate defense. Ryan was fortunate enough to have a fantastic supervisor and mentor at the Associated Counsel for the Accused – one of the best trial lawyers in Washington state. During the last year of law school, I learned how to be a courtroom lawyer and took my first case to trial. After five days, it resulted with the jury delivering two guilty verdicts (but after four hours of deliberation, so he made them think). But, because he already understood the appeals system, he told his client that she should appeal because the trial judge made a reversible error, which Ryan objected to at this trial. Essentially, the judge didn’t let him argue his theory of the case and excluded highly relevant evidence. The higher court agreed, reversed, and charges were dismissed.
        <br><br>
        The first case Ryan took to trial as a licensed attorney, he won outright with a 30 minute not guilty verdict on two counts that were originally filed as felonies. Ryan boasts a stellar trial record with proven results. Although his style of lawyering is polite and respectful when it comes to negotiating, he is not afraid of trial and welcomes it any day. No matter what your charge is, whether it be a simple speeding ticket, DUI, or serious felony, Ryan knows how to approach it.
        <br><br>
        In his spare time, Ryan enjoys working on his classic cars, exploring the Pacific Northwest, and experiencing fine arts.

                      <p>No matter how serious the charges – from disorderly conduct to assault in the first degree – we understand that it’s your life. We will tirelessly work to get you the best result possible. Every case is different and as such, requires its own unique approach. We will explore every possible avenue available and leave no stone unturned. Our trial tactics and diplomacy have created a track record of very satisfied clients.</p>
                      <p>Every crime has a list of “elements”, that is, a checklist of items that the government must possess in order to convict you. Often times, circumstances and facts are present or absent that negate a critical element of the crime charged. That is the role of the criminal defense attorney: to alert the prosecution that they either have a weak case, or no case at all.</p>
                      <p>A vast majority of cases are resolved by what we all know as a “plea deal”. Negotiations are premised on what the parties can expect to happen at trial. Trial is always a risky endeavor – no one ever truly knows what the jury is thinking. Plea deals can be seen as a compromise, and shouldn’t necessarily be viewed in a negative light. Although we always welcome taking a case to trial, we cannot make the decision for you. We will lay out all of your options for you and explain the ramifications of each and guide you in making an informed decision.</p>
                      <p>Because every case is different, there is no way for us to adequately explain the ins and outs of every situation with a “one size fits all” approach. We tailor your defense to your own special needs. That is why we encourage you to call us at anytime for a 100% free, confidential consultation.</p>
